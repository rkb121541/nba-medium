# NBA Web Scraping (2025)

I did some NBA web scraping from [basketball-reference.com](https://www.basketball-reference.com/) using these Medium articles as reference:

* [Web Scraping NBA data with Pandas, BeautifulSoup Part 1](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/web-scraping-nba-data-with-pandas-beautifulsoup-and-regex-pt-1-e3d73679950a)

    * `part1.ipynb` scrapes some data for the Miami Heat 2025 season

* [Web Scraping NBA data with Pandas, BeautifulSoup Part 2](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/web-scraping-nba-data-with-pandas-beautifulsoup-and-regex-pt-2-fa0e4c1a16fa)

    * `part2.ipynb` involves all the NBA teams

Make sure to do `time.sleep()` to avoid getting 429 request errors
